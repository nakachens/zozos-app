hey im zoe and i built this whole desktop operating system called "zozOS" for the sept monthly challenge (MY FIRST TIME AND IM SCARED AS HECK) and honestly it took me FOREVER to get it working properly.. like this project has been consuming my life for weeks now but in the best way possible you know??

About the App ⋆˚꩜｡
-
so basically i created this entire retro autumn-themed desktop environment using react and vite, and it looks SO good. it has this warm cozy aesthetic with browns and oranges and it literally feels like using a computer from the 90s but with modern functionality. the whole interface is styled like those old chunky windows with the inset borders and pixelated icons and everything.

Features of the App ⋆˚꩜｡
-
i built SO many mini applications for it too... theres a fully functional calculator app, a music player that can actually play songs (and you can upload your own too!) and has this cute retro interface, a weather app (with literally everything in it), tic tac toe, a paint program, a notebook for writing, even these little games like snake and a memory matching game. oh and this leaves catching game that i spent way too long perfecting the physics for.
the window management system was probably the hardest part - making windows draggable and resizable while keeping everything smooth and not breaking the layout.

My overall progress ⋆˚꩜｡
-
even tho the challenge was about "Vibe Coding" but i only used the AI for logics, the whole interface and structuring and styling is done by me, myself and I. I had to figure out proper z-indexing so windows layer correctly, and making sure apps scale properly when you resize them without breaking their interfaces. i got soo tired i was even thinking about this project in my dreams lol and thought it was perfect lets leave it as it is but then i got ambitious and decided to convert the whole thing into an electron app so it could run as a real desktop application instead of just in the browser. and OH MY GOD that was a whole journey in itself... spent like two days just fighting with path issues and build configurations and module systems (in stuff like this, AI helps ALOT!!) . kept getting white screens and broken assets and i was honestly getting scared i broke everything.
but i finally got it working!! now its a proper desktop app!! it has all the OS features like a taskbar with a working clock, desktop widgets you can drag around, a start menu, even window minimize/maximize animations. for now i dont know how to send the literal app to other people for a demo so i made a vercel deployment for my project so that you guys can give it a try.. (NERVOUS)!!!!!!!!!

the Main point ⋆˚꩜｡
-
the attention to detail is what im most proud of though - like the sound effects when you click buttons, the way windows have that authentic retro styling, how the desktop has floating particles in the background. i even made custom fonts work and added this virtual pet character that wanders around the screen (AND THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME ANIMATING SOMETHING BY DRAWING EACH FRAME MYSELF!!).
Ive made some folders too if you go check them out theres some little gems there hehe.. OH and i hope you find the secret button to special zozo-txt file hhehehee OH AND THE IMAGES FOLDER!! IVE PUT SOME "IN-PROGRESS" IMAGES AND SCREENSHOTS OF THE TIMES WHEN I FELT PROUD OF THE PROJECT AND WHEN I FELT FRUSTRATED WITH IT!! LIKE THE FIRST TIME I MADE THE INTERFACE, I WAS PROUD OF IT, and when my apps layout kept getting messed up, i was crying at it..

last but not the least ⋆˚꩜｡
-
honestly this project taught me so much about react state management, electron development, css styling, and just general problem solving. every time i hit a roadblock i had to figure out some creative solution. like when the music player needed to persist audio across window operations, or when i had to make sure file paths worked in both development and production builds. AND when i had to completely change the structure because in web deployment my assets werent loading? oh yeah that was one hell of a pain.. honestly this really felt like a "challenge" to me. i learnt, i cried, i tried thousands of fixes, retrys, asking copilot for help that i surpassed my free trial and had to work on fixes MYSELF... oh god.. atleast everything works now.. i hope you guys like it..
its been exhausting but also incredibly satisfying to see it all come together. i hope you guys could actually download and use this little operating system i built from scratch and experience this cozy retro computing vibe i went for. (for now you can use the web version hahaha) the whole thing just makes me happy to look at and use you know?? ueueue
